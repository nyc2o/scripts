#+TITLE: Emacs shell Script

* Purpose
This script serves to run my development environment—Emacs to much fast than executing a lot of commands like:

Going on my development environment—shell.nix, Emacs:
#+begin_src shell
$ cd ~/emacs-shell
$ nix-shell
$ emacs
#+end_src
Since I always use Emacs everyday it tires me to repeatedly doing commands above so I made a script to run my Emacs—development environment much faster than those commands.
